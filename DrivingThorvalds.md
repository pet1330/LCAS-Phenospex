## Controlling a Thorvalds with a Controller

 ![Thorvalds Controller](./controller.jpg) 

Referring to the image above; 

- 3 is propulsion forwards and backwards, 
- 1 is steering left and right (propulsion is required to see this). 
- 5 will decrease the maximum speed and 
- 10 will increase it. 
    By default,the speed is 0.75m/s and decrements and increments by 0.1m/s for each button press to a minimum of 0.1m/s and a maximum of 1.5m/s. To return to the default, press 5 and 10 together.

- To switch between moving laterally or longitudinally hold button 8 and press left or up respectively on 2.

- To pivot on the spot, hold Y and press 6 and 9 one after the other, then hold Y and press either 6 or 9 to rotate clockwise or anticlockwise.

## NOTE

It is probably best for you to lower the speed as far as you can for your first drive. Button 1 is the emergency stop. This will turn off power to the motors and stop the robot immediately. There will also be a constant beeping if the estop is pressed to let you know that it is activated.
